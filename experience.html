<font size="4">One of the valuable experiences that I would like to share with you all is the experience when I participated and joined in the <a href="https://www.revolutionise.com.au/newcastlefa/about/what-is-floorball/" target="_blank">Floorball</a> Tournament Johor State Schools in 2018 organized by the Johor state floorball association, UNIKL MITEC, MNSJ and Johor state education department. This tournament took place on 14 and 15 July 2018 at UNIKL MITEC, Pasir Gudang, Bandar Seri Alam, Johor.
</p>
<p>
At this competition, my school which is SMK Medini got third place in the womenâ€™s category. It was an enjoyable moment and a valuable experience to join the competition and represent one group or team against teams from another school in Johor state. Before this, the floorball club in my school only held training sessions every Tuesday, thus, this was the first entry for my school to send a group and team from the women's and men's categories to join the big tournaments which involved various schools from the state of Johor. There are a lot of new things that I have learned by joining this tournament as it was also a valuable and memorable experience for me</font>

<p>
<font size="4">Other than that, I also have valuable experiences and opportunities during my 6 weeks of industrial training at the Library of Polytechnic Ibrahim Sultan, Pasir Gudang, Johor. Many activities that I learned as well as joined the library to conduct the activities. I also joined and helped with all the preparations during the <a href="gallery.html">Convocation Ceremony of Polytechnic Ibrahim Sultan</a>, it is because the library unit including all the staff and librarians is responsible to handle and giving the convocation robes to all the graduates. Thus, I could feel the atmosphere on the day of the convocation ceremony for degree and diploma graduates.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font size="4">Moreover, I also have the opportunity to get to know all the staff in the library, students in the Polytechnic, services and information provided by the library, the techniques and skills for doing the job and so on. Several services provided by this library include circulation services, reference services, membership, an online database and so on. Even though this industrial training is for academic purposes, it is a very valuable and memorable experience in my life as an initial exposure to the world or field of work</font>
